# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Ai Image Generator
- This project is a training project to understand the principles of working with generators
- At the moment this project can only send requests with POST methods, and send you the generated image that you wrote in the string
- Stack: React.js + React-Query. For styling I used SCSS
